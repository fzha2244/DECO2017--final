# DECO2017-final
## The role of the website :
This website helps users to manage their study schedules.
It is essentially a reminder site for students, but I have integrated a number of features to help students make better use of the site for learning
## Function list :
* List of tasks that can be entered
* Music player on each page
* Stopwatch timer
* Pomodoro and pop-up reminders
* Kanban function
* Dictionary function with external api
## Difficulties encountered
When I finished the code test4, I found that the page had a lot of problems for mobile adaptation. So I did a code rewrite in the js section specifically for mobile.

There were some problems with the adaptation of the dictionary function, the search box could not jump to the page correctly. But I solved this problem when I checked the help documentation.
